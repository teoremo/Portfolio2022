							Our team was tasked with finding an unmet need in the sports industry
							and we decided to investigate why many young kids don’t enjoy practicing
							sports.<br />We began by carrying out desk research and consulted with
							experts to understand the problem and find any untapped opportunity.<br /><br /><strong
								>Our research showed that shyness is a common factor among kids who
								are deemed to be“lazy”.</strong
							><br />The period of most rapid development of motor behaviors and
							relational skills is between 2 and 6 years of age so we decided to focus
							on a solution that would help young kids overcoming shyness barriers
							while encouraging physical activity. <br /><br />By conducting further
							research we learned how psychologists rely on music to improve
							interactions between people, and facilitate the creation of new
							relationships. <br />Looking at how might we use music to help young
							kids get into team sports, we came up with a range of concept ideas and

							Gimble is an educational course that introduces kids to sports using
							motion sensors and music as playful ways to support physical activities
							and encourage interaction with others.<br /><br />For each thematic
							lesson, kids movements are highlighted by sounds, helping them to

							<strong

						<h3>Exploratory research</h3>
						<p class="project__article__p--small">
							The final course of the MSc in Product Service System Design aimed at
							guiding students through the entire process of developing a commercially
							viable innovative idea to solve an existing problem in a defined
							sector.<br />Our team was tasked to focus on young people in the sport
							industry and, having looked at case studies to find inspiration, we
							started conducting design research.
							<strong
								>By carrying out extensive desk research and asking to parents with
								young kids what problems they were experiencing, we found out that,
								for many children, engaging in team sports is very
								challenging.</strong
							><br /><br />Between the two and four years of age, children go through
							a phase of "strangers’ anxiety" as they become afraid of people they
							don’t know. They experience an abrupt jump from being alone to be in big
							groups.
							<strong
								>It’s estimated that between 20% and 48% of children have shy
								personalities.</strong
							><br /><br />We also found that the reason why some kids face
							difficulties when interacting for the first time in big group sports is
							that they were not introduced early enough to sport. This might lead to
							problems later in their life, like difficulties in relationships with
							others or in participating in physical activities.

						<h3>Concept development</h3>

							‘giocodanza’, two disciplines that help children develop self-awareness
							so we reached out to some instructors to learn more about their
							activities and see if they were interested in co-designing the idea
							further with us.<br /><br />Over the following few weeks, with their
							help and through a series of research and ideation activities, we
							refined the concept and got ready to prototype it.

						<h4>The concept</h4>
						<p class="project__article__p--small">
							Gimble is a course dedicated to children between 2 and 6 years of age.
							<br />During each lesson, the child is introduced to a range of
							activities within an imaginary, playful context. S/He is the character
							of an engaging story and the adult who facilitates becomes their guide
							and helper.<br /><br /><strong
								>Kids are eased into each fictional environment with the help of
								background sounds. For example, might the theme be ‘a pirate
								adventure’, speakers would play adventurous melodies, parrots
								chirps, sounds of the sea and cannon explosions.</strong
							><br /><br />All participants wear sensors to wrists and ankles to track
							their body in the space. Datas are then interpreted by a software and
							translated into sounds associated to specific movements. Onomatopeic
							sounds are closest to the child, and easier to distinguish. Let’s take
							the pirates environment: a jump over an obstacle is underlined by an
							adventurous explosion.

							Following the theories of psychomotricity, objects in use during each
							lesson are chosen for their "non-strong meaning". <br />With the help of
							sounds and music, kids can transform them in their imagination and give
							them a different meaning according to each activity’s theme.
							<br /><br /><strong
								>In a “pirates” themed lesson, every time a child jumps inside a
								rope displayed as a circle, Gimble produces a sound of water,
								transforming the rope into a puddler; a ground line becomes the
								bridge of the boat, a sheets tunnel becomes the undergrowth of a
								forest.</strong
							><br /><br />From a technological perspective, we wanted to ensure our
							idea was going to be feasible. <br />We came across some relatively
							inexpensive Arduino prototypes that used sensors like gyroscopes to
							detect position and movement in the space. To start with, we estimated
							the costs of producing those devices by oursleves; however, as we also
							looked for any existing solution, we found <em>Notch</em> - a company

						<h3>The business logic</h3>
						<p class="project__article__p--small">
							As we moved into designing the business logic, we explored a range of
							business models - and we eventually focused on training and licensing
							childhood professionals instead of providing the course ourselves, or
							selling individual products.<br />Inspired by business models like the
							one Zumba relies on, we considered how could our course scale up
							further, and envisioned a system of additional services, upgrades and
							even activities for entirely different audiences.<br /><br /><strong
								>Mapping the key elements of our ideas on a business model canvas
								helped understanding the full business logic</strong
							>
							and estimating logistic costs associated to providing training courses.
							Looking at the average price asked by potential competitors, we
							established a starting licensing price.<br /><br />For the supply and
							development of the product we realised that estabilishing a partnership
							with Notch would be the most cost-effective way forward. Notch is a
							company that produces wearable sensors designed to be attached to the
							extremities of the body to track and capture specific body movements. We
							assumed the partnership would be of their interest as, at the time, the
							company was about to release an API to open it’s product up to third
							party developers’ ideas. <br /><br />When it came to designing
							activities and exercises,
							<strong
								>we thought we’d rely on the expertise of those psychomotriciants
								who helped us defining the idea</strong
							>
							in the first place and who showed interest in extending the partnership
							further.

						<h3>Prototyping phase</h3>
						<p class="project__article__p--small">
							To bring the idea to life and learn what would people actually think
							about it, we involved psychomotricy teachers, gyms instructor, kids and
							their parents to prototype Gimble.<br /><br />Some of the questions we
							wanted to explore include:<br /><em
								>&gt; “How would kids actually react to our idea? Would they
								actually get excited about producing sounds by moving around?”</em
							><br /><em
								>&gt; “Would parents think Gimble’s value proposition differs from
								any other option already on the market? How much would they be
								willing to pay for the course?”</em
							><br /><em
								>&gt; “Looking at the theories of Psychomotricity, would the concept
								be valid? Would the product find any further application in the
								discipline?</em
							><br /><em
								>&gt; “Would any gym be interested in partnering up to offer a
								course like Gimble? ”</em
							><br /><br />The activity took place in a nonprofit association for mums
							based in Milan. As the coordinators showed interest in testing Gimble,
							we organised an event and promoted it on the association’s social
							channels and collected a number of subscriptions.

							The evening of the event, we welcomed a small number of kids and their
							mums and introduced them to the activities.<br /><br />We prototyped a
							fictional lesson from Gimble course: we performed an adventure story,
							which suggested a path of exercises for the kids - developed with the
							help of psychomotricity instructors.<br /><br />To simulate our main
							device’s features, we initially thought we’d rely on smartphone’s
							gyroscope sensors to produce music,
							<strong
								>but as that could distract kids and be heavy to carry around, we
								decided to opt for a simpler option instead.</strong
							>
							We used a sound sampler to imitate Gimble sensors behaviour, and every
							time a kid performed a correct movement, we played a specific sound.
							<br /><br />At the end of the story - and activities, we sat down with
							the participants, had a snack together and asked them a few simple
							questions to hear about their experience. We eventually interviewed
							their parents to gather feedback and understand
							<strong
								>whether they’d consider a full-lenght course for their
								children.</strong

							Overall, the prototype proved to work well. The kids who took part in
							the lesson loved it, and their parents were really keen to receiving
							updates on any further development.
							<strong
								>We learned a lot about how different kids behave and would respond
								to activities like the one we proposed and got to understand more
								about what and how would mums be keen to invest for their
								children.</strong
							><br /><br />As towards the end of the course our team managed to
							successfully validate the concept idea , we spent the last few days
							having fun exploring other activities: how about using sounds to make an
							inflatable ballon into an adventurous “Star Wars” lightsaber? Or,
							perhaps, into a gracious fairy’s magic wand?
